    <h2>Coast Toast</h2>
        <p class="poem">
            There once was a girl from the coast<br>Who called me to say "I want toast".<br>I told her I'd fly, to get there in time<br>To share a piece or two.
        </p>
    <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
            <div class= "firstline">I am very interested in video games. I wouldn't say I'm an elite gamer because I don't play</div>
            as often as others but, when I have time in my day, I like to spend it playing a great game.<br>
            At this point in my life my favorite video games are Destiny 2, Sea of Thieves, and Rocket League. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class= "firstline">Another interest/hobby that I have is shooting. I love going out to the shooting range and</div>
            hitting clay pigeons with my 12 gauge. I like taking my friends and family out and showing<br>
            them how to safely and properly operate firearms. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class= "firstline">I love eating out. Finding new places to eat gives me a rush. I would love to take a vacation</div>
            where I go find interesting places to eat and spend all my money on foods that I've<br>
            never tried. I'm lucky because my wife shares this same interest so I think we will take a<br>
            vacation like that.
        </p>
